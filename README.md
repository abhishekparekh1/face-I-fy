# face-I-fy

The group brings upon the novel approach to improve upon the drive thru experience in food outlets and shops. For this project we wish to design a facial expression scanner with eye movement detector that can help user add things to her cart. This would involve no use of keyboard or mouse of any type. The scrolling of the web page will also be through head movement which saves tons of infinite clicking and navigating. We also use classification and machine learning functionality to suggest items based on the past experiences and tag items based on the facial expressions about the feelings of all users towards a particular item and report the data back to the organization as a feedback on their services. We think the time taken to interact with the system using our proposed model will be 5x faster than pointing the mouse and clicking on it. The time that the user spends on viewing a particular item detects his interest and suggesting similar items would also lead to more sales which would drastically benefit the organization.
